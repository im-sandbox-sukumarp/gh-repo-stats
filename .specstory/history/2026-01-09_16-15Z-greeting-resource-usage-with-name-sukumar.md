The user wants me to use a "greeting resource" with the name "Sukumar". This sounds like they want me to interact with an MCP (Model Context Protocol) resource. Let me check the MCP configuration file they have open to understand what resources are available.I can see there's a "demo-mcp" server configured. Looking at the available tools, I can see there's a `mcp_demo-mcp_generate_poem` tool available. However, for a "greeting resource", this would typically be accessed differently.

Let me generate a greeting for you using the available MCP tools. Since I see the demo-mcp server has a poem generation capability, let me create a greeting poem for Sukumar:

The user is asking me to get a "greeting resource" from an MCP server for "sukumar". Looking at the available tools, I can see there are MCP tools available like `mcp_demo-mcp_add` and `mcp_demo-mcp_generate_poem`. However, I don't see a specific "greeting resource" tool.

Let me check the MCP configuration file to understand what's available. The user is viewing `/Users/sukumarp/VSCode-Projects/gh-repo-stats/.vscode/mcp.json`, so let me read that file to understand what MCP servers are configured.

Actually, MCP resources are different from tools - resources are read-only data that can be accessed. The tools I have available are for invoking actions, but resources would need a different mechanism to access.

Let me read the mcp.json file to see what's configured.I can see the MCP server configuration. Unfortunately, MCP **resources** (like a greeting resource) are not directly accessible through the tools I have available. The tools I have from the demo-mcp server are:
- `mcp_demo-mcp_add` - Add two numbers
- `mcp_demo-mcp_generate_poem` - Generate a poem

MCP resources are read-only data endpoints that need to be accessed differently than tools. In VS Code, you would typically access MCP resources through the Copilot Chat interface by typing `#` and selecting the resource, or the MCP server would need to expose it as a tool.

If you'd like, I can:
1. **Generate a greeting poem** for Sukumar using the available `generate_poem` tool
2. **Check the MCP server code** to see if there's a way to expose the greeting as a tool

Would you like me to generate a greeting poem for Sukumar, or would you prefer to explore the MCP server code to see what resources it offers?
