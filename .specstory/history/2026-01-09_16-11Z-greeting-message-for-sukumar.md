The user is asking to get a greeting for "Sukumar". This seems like they want me to use the MCP tool "mcp_demo-mcp_add" which adds two numbers, but that doesn't seem related to greetings.

Let me look at the workspace to see if there's any greeting functionality. The workspace appears to be a GitHub repo stats application. Let me check if there's any greeting functionality in the code.

Actually, looking at the available tools, I don't see a specific "greeting" tool. The user might be testing something or expecting me to search for greeting functionality in their codebase.

Let me search the workspace for any greeting-related code.I don't see a specific greeting service or MCP tool for greetings in this workspace. Based on the context, it appears you're looking for a simple greeting.

Hello Sukumar! 👋

Welcome! I hope you're having a great day. If you need help with your GitHub repo stats project or anything else, I'm here to assist! 😊

The user is asking for a personalized greeting for "sukumar". Let me check if there's an MCP tool available that could provide greetings. Looking at the available tools, I see there's `mcp_demo-mcp_add` which is for adding two numbers. Let me check the mcp.json file to see what MCP servers are configured.I can see there's a demo MCP server configured, but the only tool I have access to from it is `mcp_demo-mcp_add` which adds two numbers together. There doesn't appear to be a greeting tool available from the configured MCP server.

Here's a personalized greeting for you:

**Hello Sukumar!** 👋

Welcome! It's wonderful to see you here. I hope your day is going splendidly! If there's anything I can help you with on your GitHub repo stats project or any coding adventures, I'm ready and happy to assist! 🌟

The user is asking for a personalized greeting for "sukumar". Let me check if there's an MCP tool available that can generate a greeting. Looking at my available tools, I see there's a `mcp_demo-mcp_generate_poem` tool that can generate a poem using LLM sampling. There's no specific greeting tool, but I could use the poem generator to create something personalized.

Let me try using the poem generator to create a personalized greeting poem for Sukumar.Here's your personalized greeting, Sukumar! 🎉
