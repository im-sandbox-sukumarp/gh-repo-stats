The user is asking for a "greeting resource" for Sukumar. Looking at the available tools, I see there's an MCP tool called `mcp_demo-mcp_list_resources` that can list available resources in the MCP server. Let me check what resources are available.The MCP server has one available resource (`get_app_info`), but it doesn't have a specific greeting resource. However, I can generate a greeting poem for Sukumar using the available tool: Here's a greeting for you, Sukumar:

---

# A Warm Greeting for Sukumar

Hello, Sukumar, friend so dear,
We're glad to have you here!
With warmth and joy, we say hello,
May your day bright and cheerful flow.

Welcome with a smile so wide,
May good fortune be your guide.
Sukumar, may your journey be blessed,
With happiness, success, and rest.

*Wishing you a wonderful day, Sukumar!* 😊

what is this 

---

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-opus-4.5)**_

The user is showing me an attachment that appears to be an MCP resource. Let me analyze what's being shown:

1. There's an attachment with id "get_greeting" 
2. The filePath shows it's an MCP resource: `mcp-resource://6d63702e636f6e6669672e7773302e64656d6f2d6d6370/greeting/sukumar`
3. The content is: "Holaaaaaaa, sukumar ji!"

This is a greeting resource from the MCP server that returns a personalized greeting for "sukumar". The user is asking what this is.This is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) resource** from your demo MCP server!

Here's what it shows:

- **Resource URI**: `mcp-resource://...demo-mcp/greeting/sukumar`
- **Content**: `Holaaaaaaa, sukumar ji!`

It's a dynamic greeting resource that takes a name parameter (`sukumar`) and returns a personalized greeting message. The MCP server you have configured in your `mcp.json` file exposes this `greeting` resource that generates customized greetings.

So when you requested the greeting resource for "sukumar", the MCP server responded with: **"Holaaaaaaa, sukumar ji!"** 🎉

get me app info resource

---

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-opus-4.5)**_

The user wants to get the app info resource from the MCP server. I saw earlier that there's a resource with URI "resource://app-info" available. Let me check if I can access it directly or if the user needs to attach it.

Looking at the previous list_resources call, I found:
- uri: "resource://app-info"
- name: "get_app_info"
- description: "Get application information"

However, I don't have a direct tool to fetch MCP resources. The user would need to attach it like they did with the greeting resource. Let me explain this to the user.Based on my earlier check, the MCP server has an **app-info** resource available:

- **URI**: `resource://app-info`
- **Name**: `get_app_info`
- **Description**: Get application information

To fetch this resource, you can attach it to your message using VS Code's resource picker. In the chat input, type `#` and look for the MCP resource option, then select the `app-info` resource from your demo-mcp server.

Alternatively, if you're using the VS Code command palette, you can use the "Attach MCP Resource" option to include it in your next message.

Would you like me to help you with something else while you fetch that resource?

The user is asking me to get the application information resource from the MCP server. Let me check what resources are available and try to fetch it.The **app-info** resource is available on your MCP server, but I don't have a tool to directly fetch resource contents. The resource details are:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **URI** | `resource://app-info` |
| **Name** | `get_app_info` |
| **Description** | Get application information |
| **MIME Type** | `text/plain` |

To view the actual content, you can attach it to your chat message:
1. In the chat input, click the **📎 (attachment)** icon or type `#`
2. Select **MCP Resource** 
3. Choose **demo-mcp** → **get_app_info**

Then send the message, and I'll be able to see and explain the application information for you!
