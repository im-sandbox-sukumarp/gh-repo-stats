# Viewing auth information for MCP server (2026-01-21 06:21Z)

_**User (2026-01-21 06:23Z)**_

@vscode  How to view the auth information for an MCP server installed in workspace 

---

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-opus-4.5)**_

To view the authentication information for an MCP server installed in your workspace, use the **MCP: List Servers** command. This will show you details about your configured MCP servers, including their authentication status.



You can also open your workspace MCP configuration directly using the **MCP: Open Workspace MCP Configuration** command to view the server settings.

The user is asking about where the Atlassian MCP server stores its authentication configuration. Let me first read the MCP configuration file to see how the Atlassian server is configured.The Atlassian MCP server in your configuration uses **HTTP/SSE transport** connecting to `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse`. 

For HTTP-based MCP servers like this one, VS Code stores the authentication credentials in the **VS Code Secret Storage**, not in the `mcp.json` file itself. This is a secure storage mechanism that keeps sensitive tokens encrypted.

To view or manage the auth status:

1. **Check auth status**: Run the command **MCP: List Servers** (`Cmd+Shift+P` → "MCP: List Servers") - this will show whether the server is authenticated

2. **Re-authenticate**: If you need to re-authenticate, you can:
   - Right-click the server in the MCP Servers view and select "Authenticate"
   - Or run **MCP: Authenticate Server** command

3. **Clear stored credentials**: Run **MCP: Reset Cached Credentials** to remove stored auth tokens

The actual OAuth tokens are stored securely by VS Code and are not directly accessible in plain text files. This is by design for security purposes - the credentials are managed through VS Code's built-in secret storage API, which uses the operating system's secure credential storage (Keychain on macOS).
