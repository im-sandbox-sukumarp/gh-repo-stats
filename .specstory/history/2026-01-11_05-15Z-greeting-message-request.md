The user is asking to "get greeting". Looking at the attachments, I can see there's a resource attached with id "get_greeting" that appears to be from an MCP server (mcp-resource://). The content shows a pyproject.toml file for a "demo-mcp" project.

However, looking at my available tools, I have MCP tools from "demo-mcp" including:
- mcp_demo-mcp_add - Add two numbers
- mcp_demo-mcp_generate_poem - Generate a poem using LLM sampling
- mcp_demo-mcp_list_resources - List all available resources in the MCP server

The attachment seems to be a resource from the MCP server. The user wants to "get greeting" - let me check what resources are available or if there's a greeting resource I can access.

Let me first list the available resources to see what's there.The MCP server has one available resource (`app-info`), but there isn't a direct "get greeting" tool available. However, I can see from the attachment that you have a greeting resource at `mcp-resource://...greeting/suku`. 

The attachment you shared shows the content of a `pyproject.toml` file from the demo-mcp project:

```
[project]
name = "demo-mcp"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    "mcp[cli]>=1.25.0",
]
```

This is the project configuration for a demo MCP server. If you were expecting a personalized greeting, the MCP server's greeting resource for "suku" returned this project information.

Would you like me to do something specific with this information, or were you expecting a different kind of greeting?
